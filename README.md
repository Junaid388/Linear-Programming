# Linear-Programming
Linear programming is the process of finding the optimized condition (the maxima and/or minima) of a function, given various linear inequalities as constraints.
However, let it be known that linear programming was invented by mathematically-minded thinkers for war. In order to determine the best way to move supplies (like gasoline, food, soldiers, â€¦) to place them where they were immediately needed to increase the effectiveness for military campaigns, this mathematics was developed.
It turned out that this mathematics had broader applications than war alone. So, students learn it ti make important changes to business to increase their potential and make greater profit.
Linear programing can also be applied to stratedy games, much like Clash of Clans, to optimize performance and be a better player.
 
 In order to do formulate linear programming we will follow five steps, starting with translating from words to mathematics. 
 Step 1: Define Your Variables
 Step 2 - Define the Objective Function
 Step 3 - Writing the Constraints
 Step 4 - Implement the linear model
 Step 4 - Check the optimal Result
